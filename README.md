# :no_entry: [DEPRECATED] Flexible Content Preview has become [Flexible Content Extended for Advanced Custom Fields](https://github.com/jameelmoses/acf-flexible-content-extended)

Transforms ACF's flexible content field's layout list into a modal with image previews.

## Image Conventions

* The size of the image should be 732 x 300.
* They should be named based on the layout's name (`text_block`) with underscores converted to dashes (`text-block.jpg`).

## Image Location

Images should be placed in your theme. By default, images are located here: `THEME/lib/admin/images/acf-flexible-content-preview`.

Also note that you can filter this path, but it **MUST** be in your theme:

`add_filter( 'acf-flexible-content-preview.images_path', $path );`

**NOTE:** The path should not have a trailing beginning or trailing slash!

Additionally, you could filter all keys and/or images:

`add_filter( 'acf-flexible-content-preview.images', $images );`
