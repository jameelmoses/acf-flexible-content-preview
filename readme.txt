Transforms ACF's flexible content field's layout list into a modal with image previews.

== Description ==

Transforms ACF's flexible content field's layout list into a modal with image previews.

= Image Conventions =

* The size of the image should be 732 x 300.
* They should be named based on the layout's name (`text_block`) with underscores converted to dashes (`text-block.jpg`).

= Image Location =

Images should be placed in your theme. Be fault, images are located here: `THEME/lib/admin/images/acf-flexible-content-preview`.
A file with name `default.jpg` can be placed here to overwrite the default grey image.

Also note that you can filter this path, but it **MUST** be in your theme:

`add_filter( 'acf-flexible-content-preview.images_path', $path );`

You can also set a custom path for only the `default.jpg` image:

`add_filter( 'acf-flexible-content-preview.default_path', $path );`

Note that if you have already defined a custom images_path you can place your `default.jpg` at that location.

**NOTE:** The path should not have a trailing beginning or trailing slash!

Additionally, you could filter all keys and/or images:

`add_filter( 'acf-flexible-content-preview.images', $images );`
